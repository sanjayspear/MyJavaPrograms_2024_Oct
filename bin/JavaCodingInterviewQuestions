These questions cover a variety of topics in programming such as string manipulation, array handling, matrix operations, 
and logical problem-solving. They are ideal for practice or coding interviews.

Here is a list of programming questions corresponding to each of the different approaches for 
reversing a string:

1. Using a for Loop (Manual Character Swapping)
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using a for loop. Do not use any built-in reverse methods.

2. Using StringBuilder or StringBuffer (Built-in Reverse Method)
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using StringBuilder or StringBuffer. Use the built-in reverse() method.

3. Using Recursion
Question:
Write a recursive Java program to reverse a string. The program should call a method recursively to reverse the characters in the string.

4. Using char[] Array (Swapping Elements)
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string by converting it to a char[] array, then manually swapping the elements of the array.

5. Using Streams (Java 8+)
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using Java 8 streams. The program should use streams to reverse the characters of the string.

6. Using StringJoiner and split()
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string by splitting it into individual characters and using StringJoiner to join them in reverse order.

7. Using Stack Data Structure
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using a stack. The program should push all characters onto the stack and then pop them off to reverse the string.

8. Using XOR Swap Algorithm
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using the XOR swap algorithm. Convert the string into a char[] array, then use XOR swapping to reverse the characters in the array.

9. Using Apache Commons StringUtils.reverse()
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using the Apache Commons StringUtils.reverse() method. Import the required library and use the built-in method to reverse the string.

10. Using Java Deque
Question:
Write a Java program to reverse a string using a Deque (double-ended queue). Add each character to the deque, then remove them from the end to reverse the string.
