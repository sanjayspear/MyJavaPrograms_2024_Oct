5. Find the Maximum Product of Two Numbers
Problem:
Find the maximum product that can be obtained from two numbers in the array.
Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 4]
Example Output: 12 (from 3 * 4)

6. Find the Longest Consecutive Sequence
Problem:
Find the length of the longest consecutive sequence in an unsorted array.
Example Input: [100, 4, 200, 1, 3, 2]
Example Output: 4 (sequence is [1, 2, 3, 4])

7. Rearrange an Array Alternately
Problem:
Given a sorted array, rearrange it in alternating max/min form.
Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]
Example Output: [6, 1, 5, 2, 4, 3]

8. Find the Subarray with the Maximum Sum (Kadane’s Algorithm)
Problem:
Find the contiguous subarray within an array that has the largest sum.
Example Input: [-2, 1, -3, 4, -1, 2, 1, -5, 4]
Example Output: 6 (from [4, -1, 2, 1])

9. Sort an Array of 0s, 1s, and 2s
Problem:
Sort an array containing only 0, 1, and 2 without using extra space or sorting algorithms.
Example Input: [0, 1, 2, 1, 0, 1, 2]
Example Output: [0, 0, 1, 1, 1, 2, 2]

10. Find the First Non-Repeating Element
Problem:
Find the first non-repeating element in an array.
Example Input: [9, 4, 9, 6, 7, 4]
Example Output: 6

11. Find the Second Largest Element in an Array
Problem:
Find the second largest element in an array without sorting the array.
Example Input: [10, 5, 20, 8]
Example Output: 10

12. Count Inversions in an Array
Problem:
An inversion is when a pair (i, j) satisfies i < j and arr[i] > arr[j]. Count the number of inversions in the array.
Example Input: [2, 4, 1, 3, 5]
Example Output: 3

13. Rearrange an Array to Place Negative Numbers Before Positive Numbers
Problem:
Rearrange an array such that all negative numbers appear before positive numbers while maintaining their relative order.
Example Input: [1, -2, 3, -4, 5]
Example Output: [-2, -4, 1, 3, 5]

14. Move All Zeroes to the End of the Array
Problem:
Move all zeroes to the end of the array while maintaining the relative order of the other elements.
Example Input: [0, 1, 0, 3, 12]
Example Output: [1, 3, 12, 0, 0]

15. Find the Majority Element in an Array
Problem:
Find the element that appears more than n/2 times in an array of size n.
Example Input: [3, 3, 4, 2, 3, 3, 3]
Example Output: 3

16. Find the Pair with the Closest Sum to Zero
Problem:
Find a pair of numbers in the array whose sum is closest to zero.
Example Input: [-8, 4, 5, -10, 3]
Example Output: [-8, 5]

17. Find All Subarrays with a Given Sum
Problem:
Find all subarrays in the array that sum up to a given value.
Example Input: [1, 2, 3, 7, 5], sum = 12
Example Output: [2, 3, 7]

18. Find the Smallest Subarray with a Given Sum
Problem:
